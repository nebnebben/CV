## Projects
 
 **Example Projects on Github** <br>

**Prisoner’s Dilemma Experiment** <br>
I experimented with how game theory strategies performed by competing agents changed over time, and how those strategies evolved within a population of those agents within simulations I coded from scratch. <br>

**Neural Architecture Search** <br>
I designed and programmed an algorithm to automatically find complex neural network architectures for a user-inputted problem, creating solutions that trade-off between different objectives such as accuracy and network size. <br>

 **Genetic algorithms for conway's game of life** <br>
Out of interest in cellular automata, I designed from scratch a program that used genetic algorithms to find optimally dense structures within Conway’s Game of Life. <br>

**Pirate Game** <br>
as team leader, I developed a pirate action game from design to execution. As well as leadership, this took commitment, time management and great teamwork, and built my coding, testing and documentation skills. <br>

**Raspberry Pi Project** <br>
in this University group project I took on the software design, developing novel recognition software from scratch to identify specific objects with their location and number, whilst working within the computational restraints of a Raspberry Pi. <br>

## Experience

**July 2020 - Present Software Engineer, Aftermarket Arbitrage:** <br>
I have been working as a software developer, creating tools that allow for automation of online processes to help people carry out tasks faster. I have also been working on web scraping for different websites. All using Python with libraries like Requests, Scrapy and Selenium. 

**October 2019 - May 2020 - Co-founded TedX Society:** <br>
I co-founded the TedX York society of which I was the treasurer. I had to learn organisational planning such as getting in good speakers, managing events, booking and money. We had an event with speakers that was a great success and sold out a week in advance. 

**September 2019 - June 2020 - Software Engineer, Committee, York Community Consulting:** <br>
As a software engineer and a member of the committee, I worked with others to decide and develop the best technology solutions to support the organisation, for example an interactive organisational chart. This involved excellent communication with departments and external teams, writing and testing code and developing operational documentation. I also helped maintain the website and assisted in resolving technical issues.

**April 2017 - July 2017 - Gap Year Assistant, Dulwich Prep London:** <br>
This post built my organisational skills. I supervised the children at break and during sport. I also gave administrative support to teachers, which included helping organise sports day and establishing a new filing system.

**January 2017 - April 2017 - Volunteer work with Projects Abroad in Sri Lanka:** <br>
I taught basic computing skills to children from 8 to 12 years old which relied on breaking down complex concepts in a clear and understandable way. I learnt to persevere in complex situations, and to be flexible, exploring different approaches to find what worked. 

**July 2016 - Cambridge Coding Academy:** <br>
Cambridge Coding Academy develops and delivers coding courses. During this work experience, I tested their new courses, locating errors in the code, correcting these where possible, and suggesting design improvements, all against a launch deadline. I gained useful skills in problem solving, working systematically and keeping calm under pressure.

**September 2015 – June 2016 -  School Philosophy Society:** <br>
I co-founded a Philosophy Society at school. Scheduling speakers and managing logistics built my organisational skills; coping with last minute changes built my adaptability and I received very positive feedback from my talk on Artificial Intelligence.

**September 2012 – June 2015  School Computer Club:** <br>
I helped younger students improve their computer skills.

## Skills

I am proficient in languages such as Java, Python and VB.Net. and I have used languages such as Prolog, R, Javascript and Erlang. I can document efficiently, and I have used JUnit for unit testing. I am very fast at picking up new languages, and I am good at getting into complex problems.
