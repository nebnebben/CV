## Projects


## Skills and Experience

**October 2019 - Ongoing - Co-founded TedX Society:** <br>
I co-founded TedX society of which I am the treasurer. This involves organisational planning in terms of getting in good speakers and managing events, booking and money.

**September 2019 - Ongoing - Software Engineer, Committee, York Community Consulting:** <br>
As a member of the committee, I work with others to decide the best technology solutions to support the organisation before helping to develop them, such as an interactive organisational chart. This involves excellent communication with departments and external teams; writing and testing code to support this and developing operational documentation. Additionally I have responsibility for cybersecurity and data organisation, including ensuring the security of YCC web applications, as well as managing data capture, organisation and storage. I also help maintain the website and assist in resolving technical issues.

**April 2017 - July 2017 - Gap Year Assistant, Dulwich Prep London:** <br>
This post built my organisational skills. I supervised the children at break and during sport. I also gave administrative support to teachers, which included helping organise sports day and establishing a new filing system.

**January 2017 - April 2017 - Volunteer work with Projects Abroad in Sri Lanka:** <br>
I taught basic computing skills to children from 8 to 12 years old which relied on breaking down complex concepts in a clear and understandable way. I learnt to persevere in complex situations, and to be flexible, exploring different approaches to find what worked. 

**July 2016 - Cambridge Coding Academy:** <br>
Cambridge Coding Academy develops and delivers coding courses. During this work experience, I tested their new courses, locating errors in the code, correcting these where possible, and suggesting design improvements, all against a launch deadline. I gained useful skills in problem solving, working systematically and keeping calm under pressure.

**September 2015 – June 2016 -  School Philosophy Society:** <br>
I co-founded a Philosophy Society at school. Scheduling speakers and managing logistics built my organisational skills; coping with last minute changes built my adaptability and I received very positive feedback from my talk on Artificial Intelligence.

**September 2012 – June 2015  School Computer Club:** <br>
I helped younger students improve their computer skills.
